Your name and code will be different from this example.

Your HTML must pass the validator at:

The title tag must contain your name or the string indicated by the autograder.

You must have at least one example of the following tags: span, p, div, h1, and ul

You must have three a tags and three li tags.

You must have some bold text using the strong tag in the document and some italics text using the em tag in the document but you cannot use the b or i tags. Also do not use CSS or the style attribute

There is a lot of flexibility within those parameters.
